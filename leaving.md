I am going to be deleting most of my online presence (leaving most servers, becoming inactive, removing friends, deleting socials) for some reasons I will NOT (so dont ask) say.

It's been great but it needs to end, for my own sake.

I will be stopping all private development for all servers. (I will send an folder witl all the code and instructions on how to use it to you)

I will be leaving most servers I am in and will become inactive in the ones I stay in.

In terms of accepting jobs, I won't be.

I am going to try to focus on myself, my studies, the amazing people around me, and my family.
